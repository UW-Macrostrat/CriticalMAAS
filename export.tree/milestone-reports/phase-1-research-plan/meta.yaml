  This document presents Macrostrat's research plan for Phase 1 of the CriticalMAAS project.
  Macrostrat's main goal is to provide the highest-possible quality geologic basemap for CMA workflows,
  integrating outputs from TA1 and TA2 with other NGMDB, USGS, and external data sources. This basemap
  will be usable across scales and project areas, with consistent API-driven data access patterns usable by TA3 workflows.
  To solve alignment problems that have been documented for past CMA workflows, we will prioritize the linking of
  geological data into a consistent entity framework, driven by geologic unit matching across data sources.
  We will also work with other CriticalMAAS performers
  to build feedback capabilities into their data synthesis workflows, especially for TA1 and TA2.
