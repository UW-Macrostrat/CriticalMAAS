# Introduction

The primary objective of our TA4 activities is to adapt and leverage the
Macrostrat and xDD data systems for the CriticalMAAS workflow. This places
emphasis on the geological data that are central to TA3 modelling pipeline. Our
specific immediate objectives are to _(1)_ build a geological map ingestion and
harmonization system for TA1 output that can rapidly augment the more than 300
geological maps that are already available in Macrostrat and tailoring the map
data access points (APIs and tile servers) to conform with TA3 requirements, and
_(2)_ establish an xDD corpus and document annotation and distribution pipeline
that can faciliate TA2 data extraction tasks. We are attempting to facilitate
integration of TA1 and some of TA2 outputs by focusing on geological units that
appear in maps, geologic columns, and the literature, the goal being to augument
map/column units with additional geological data that can be used in modelling
steps. This initial thrust is, therefore, largely focused on integrating data
extraction and assimilation pipelines that are directed towards TA3.
Human-in-the-loop interfaces for assessing, annotating, and editing the data
from TA1 and TA2 will also be developed as the data flow pipelines are
established. Here we report on our Phase 1 research plan to accomplish these
objectives.

## Success criteria for Macrostrat TA4 system

In addition to fulfilling the goals set out in the Phase 1 Evaluation Plan, we
seek to establish a system that can support CriticalMAAS performers in response
to the following challenges:

- Can we provide the data produced by TA1 and TA2 to TA3 (and other TA4
  performers), on demand and en masse?
- Can we augment and standardize these datasets to provide relevant geological
  information, particularly lithology and geological unit properties?

These guiding questions are intended to focus our work on the key challenges
that face Macrostrat, in conversation with the goals, activities, and expertise
of the other TA4 performers.

## Adjustments in response to project integration

We have adapted our approach somewhat in light of initial integrations with
other performers and discussions with other TAs.

First, we will plan to integrate with capabilities led by other TA4 performers:

- Jataware will produce some end-to-end solutions particularly for
  georeferencing and page-level evaluation of map data objects. This may reduce
  the need for Macrostrat-led user interfaces in these domains (see
  @sec:document-interfaces).
- MTRI will work with TA3 to ensure that geologic mapping data provided by
  Macrostrat in vector-tile format can be filtered and subset according to the
  needs of model pipelines and operators (@sec:geologic-map-data)

Second, based on descriptions of bottlenecks in CMA process workflows (e.g.,
_Lawley et al, 2022_), and the expected structure of TA1 and TA2 outputs, we
forecast that a major problem will be assembing a geologic dataset that is
sufficiently well-characterized and standardized to be useful across scales and
study areas to extract fairly specific CMA-relevant information. Given this
expected challenge, we will devote extra effort to internally characterizing and
harmonizing geologic map units, in order to provide appropriately queryable TA1
and TA2 datasets. This activity has therefore been upgraded to a major thrust of
our software development plan (@sec:entity-characterization).

# Software development plan

Our software development plan will prioritize aggregating TA1-2 data to support
TA3 workflows, providing geologic data in appropriate formats for CMA, and
augmenting the attributes of geologic data to form harmonized, multiscale
products that support CMA workflows. As part of these efforts, we will build
data-providing infrastructure, APIs, and user-facing human in the loop (HITL)
interfaces. Overall progress is tracked in the
[`UW-Macrostrat/criticalmaas`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/criticalmaas)
GitHub repository, with individual software components tracked in the
repositories discussed below (an index of all repositories discussed is
available in @sec:software-index).

This plan is organized around several lines:

1. Provide geologic datasets to CriticalMAAS performers
2. Build a system for geologic map integration
3. Characterize and link geologic entities
4. Build HITL interfaces

This is broadly similar to the Tasks 1-3 developed in our initial proposal, but
with "linking geologic entities" extracted to a top-level task to align with our
new understanding of its critical importance in the context of this project
(@sec:entity-characterization).

## Providing geologic datasets for CriticalMAAS performers

Macrostrat's key task for supporting CriticalMAAS is to provide harmonized
geologic datasets over stable APIs to other CriticalMAAS performers. The most
critical task is to provide these datasets to TA3, but we will also provide them
to TA1 and TA2 to support feedback. Additionally, we will support the activities
and HITL interfaces of other TA4 performers with stable APIs (e.g., for geologic
and raster data tiles) atop shared TA4 data repositories.

### Geologic map data {#sec:geologic-map-data}

Tiled Macrostrat output, API-available in vector-based tile format has gained
agreement from MTRI (TA4) and SRI (TA3) that it has the requisite structure and
properties to be used as a base for CMA workflows. This dataset is usable on the
web, in analytical pipelines, and in QGIS and other GIS software (see
@fig:macrostrat-tile-api). We will continue to refine this output and provide it
to TA3. Our key goals for this dataset are to:

- Improve the structure of tileserver output to better support querying by TA3
  (ex., by adding ability to filter by lithology).
- Improve API capabilities for querying and filtering by relevant data fields
- Integrate attribute types discussed by Lawley et al. (2022) and others, such
  as age ranges, paleolatitude, and vetted lithologic classes.

Much of this work relies on the curation of well-attributed geologic map units
(@sec:entity-characterization). The key codebase for this work, as well as for
raster data provision, is the
[`UW-Macrostrat/tileserver`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/tileserver)
repository.

and use in multiple environments.

### Mineral site data

Site-based geologic data must also be forwarded to TA3 CMA pipelines, in a way
that allows it to be generalized across geologically relevant areas (e.g.,
through intersection with mapping data), filtered for the specific CMA task at
hand, and validated based on source material (e.g., mine reports and USGS
publications).

We have successfully validated serving point datasets relevant to CMA through
publicly accessible APIs, including the MRDS dataset (@fig:mineral-sites). We
will additionally explore approaches to linking mine-site data closely to
geologic context, and thereby enabling spatial and geological time/unit
filtering. The key codebase for these capabilities is the
[`DigitalCrust/weaver`](https://github.com/digitalcrust/weaver) GitHub
repository. This software will forward mineral site data to TA3 analytical
pipelines and TA4 HITL interfaces (ex., MTRI and/or EIS QGIS plugins).

<!--
- Make mine report data sub-settable by geologic formation, lithology, etc.
  through linking to TA1 output (and geologic mapping from other sources)
- Provide these point data objects using standardized APIs that can be queried
  and assimilated in TA3 modeling
  --->

To synthesize and validate mine site data received from TA2, we will need to
develop data pipelines and HITL interfaces that forward users to the specific
document sources that underly mine-site and mineral-system datasets (see
@sec:document-interfaces).

Macrostrat maintains links to other point datasets that may be useful to forward
to TA3, such as USGS legacy geochemical data. TA2 also plans to compile datasets
from other existing structured data sources. We will work with TA2 performers to
ensure that these datasets are available and properly contextualized for TA3. If
more site-based datasets must be integrated, we will work with TA3 to identify
and integrate them into the system, which will make them readily avaiable on
demand for modelling tasks.

![Macrostrat MRDS data layer, showing basic capabilities for point data provision. [This interface](https://staging.v2.macrostrat.org/map/dev/weaver) is publicly
available on Macrostrat's development website.](img/macrostrat-mrds-interface.png){#fig:mineral-sites
width=60%}

### Raster datasets {#sec:raster-data}

Raster datasets can generally be integrated directly into TA3 workflows.
However, compositing raster datasets across scales, and making the same datasets
available across performer teams, presents data-integration challenges that can
be supported by TA4. We have validated and will maintain key capabilities to
store and serve raster datasets, to support map feedback and CMA workflows. Our
systems will be based around storage of raster datasets as "Cloud-Optimized
GeoTIFFs" (COGs), which allow efficient use of raster datasets in networked
environments. We will also provide indexing and tiling services over these
datasets. Raster datasets will be integrated into feedback user interfaces
(e.g., @fig:paired-vector-raster) and made available for TA1-3 pipelines and
validation. The key codebase for this work is the
[`UW-Macrostrat/raster-cli`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/raster-cli) GitHub
repository. We will seek to integrate these capabilities with other TA4 systems
at the Month 3 hackathon.

### The Macrostrat infrastructure platform {#sec:macrostrat-system}

The core of the Macrostrat system consists of the databases and infrastructure
that hosts the above data capabilities. In order to maintain and extend these
APIs and data-provision systems, we will invest in the design and structure of
underlying Macrostrat systems.

The key codebases for this work are Macrostrat's
[infrastructure](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/tiger-macrostrat-config) and
[command-line interface](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/cli) GitHub
repositories. These repositories are, for now, private, due to their role in
orchestrating system components on specific infrastructure systems. Much of this
configuration will be made public as it is augmented and vetted for security.
For the final CriticalMAAS system, an end-to-end implementation encompassing the
full set of capabilities will be published.

### Literature extractions for TA2 support {#sec:geologic-literature}

Our integration with the [xDD document library](https://xdd.wisc.edu) allows us
to provide literature artifacts ready for TA2 extractions, both over USGS
documents and the broader geologic literature. We will provide datasets relevant
to CriticalMAAS (both USGS-sourced and otherwise) using existing data interfaces
(e.g., the [xDD API](https://xdd.wisc.edu/api)) and tools (the
[`UW-COSMOS/COSMOS`](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/COSMOS) entity extraction
pipeline). This work will be supported by HITL interfaces over documents
(@sec:document-interfaces). Creation of these pipelines is already well underway
as one of the first deliverables promised in our project plan
(@sec:xdd-set-progress). xDD systems can potentially play an important role in
surfacing documents and providing context within them for TA2 extractions.

We will continue to integrate with TA2 to build capabilities to access and
manipulate the literature corpus of documents from USGS and other sources,
potentially developing them further with capabilities needed for CMA. Since USGS
documents are broadly in the public domain, TA2 performers will have an
opportunity to follow all extractions back to their full source material; this
is usually encumbered by publisher agreements in the case of other literature
sources, such as Elsevier, Wiley and the like. However, specific information in
these source documents can be surfaced and integrated into knowledge bases,
provided that the code to locate and extract the information is run within UW's
CHTC environment and the output conforms to the expectations of publisher
agreements (e.g., extractions constitute a derived data product, such as a list
of entities and their relations, and not original unaltered content beyond short
snippets of context).

## Geologic map integration pipeline {#sec:map-integration}

As a first step towards HITL interfaces to standardize geological map
information (e.g., legend data, line types, etc.) from TA1 outputs, we will seek
to improve the speed and interactivity of Macrostrat's vector data ingestion
pipeline. This system moves from GIS data inputs, like Geodatabases, Shapefiles,
and ArcInfo files, to the standardized layers that drive Macrostrat APIs. The
system will be adapted to support TA1 outputs, which requires it to work
efficiently over heterogeneous and variably attributed data.

This pipeline will operate over:

- NGMDB geologic maps already published in vector form but not yet ingested into
  Macrostrat
- TA1 outputs (which will be provided in a representation analogous to existing
  vector datasets, per TA1 output schemas; @sec:schemas)
- Paired vector/raster map datasets (in conjunction with Macrostrat's raster
  pipeline; @sec:raster-data, to facilitate TA1 training tasks)

Geologic map ingestion relies on both GIS data manipulation (and in the case of
TA1 performers, image analysis), and on geological expertise. Geological
decisions include splitting unit ages from stratigraphic names, descriptions,
and lithological information in legend text, which must in many cases must be
done manually. For CriticalMAAS, it will be use useful to allow geologic
expertise to be applied without the need for data manipulation, as that will
allow geologists to more readily participate in data curation.

Data ingestion pipelines will be supplemented with web-based interfaces for
metadata and map extraction editing (@sec:map-interfaces). These interfaces will
allow geologists to interactively manipulate map data and metadata, to support
both the ingestion of accurate maps. This will potentially also allow linking to
structured data describing geologic map units synthesized from other data
sources (such as map pamphlets and geologic literature). These pipelines are
described in @sec:entity-characterization.

Several GitHub-hosted codebases are relevant to this task:

- [`UW-Macrostrat/map-integration`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/map-integration)
  will hold map ingestion/harmonization command-ine interfaces and web app.
- [`UW-Macrostrat/python-libraries`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/python-libraries)
  holds GIS-oriented Python libraries used across projects.
- [`UW-Macrostrat/cli`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/cli) holds map
  harmonization scripts. These are currently private but will be made public as
  they are vetted for sensitive information.

## Geologic entity characterization {#sec:entity-characterization}

Geologic entities are discrete packages of rock (e.g., mapped bedrock map units)
that can be characterized by a variety of attributes, including
lithostratigraphic names, lithologies, environmental/tectonic context of
formation, and geochemistry. Macrostrat maintains a database of geologic
entities represented in, for example, regional geologic columns that can be used
to further characterize geologic map units. However, Macrostrat's entity
characterization is not of adequate completeness to fully support CMA workflows.
This will be rectified by a combination of leveraging outputs from TA1-2,
augmenting those outputs with our own AI-assisted literature synthesis, and
building new HITL interfaces for curating information that better charaterizes
the properties of rock units that are relevant to CMA.

We are taking two separate approaches to this problem:

1. Finding new descriptors of existing entities by, for example, reading
   publications.
2. Finding new entities not currently represented in the database and
   incorporating them.

These two approaches will help correct several deficiencies of Macrostrat's
current representation of geologic entities, including more depauperate data on
non-sedimentary units and a relatively general characterization of lithologies
in heterogeneous units. The overarching goal of these activities is to produce
more specific representations of geologic entity properties, particularly
lithology, that are amenable to use in TA3 modelling workflows.

This system will be developed and described in the
[`UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat-xdd`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat-xdd)
GitHub repository. Feedback tools for evaluating extraction quality will be
built atop Macrostrat's map interface (@sec:map-interfaces).

![*(a)* Starting user interface and *(b)* potential additional extractions for CMA-focused entity canonicalization tasks](img/entity-canonicalization.png){#fig:entity-characterization}

## HITL interfaces for TA1-2 pipeline support

We will develop several types of HITL feedback interface to support TA1 and TA2
pipelines. We have already produced several prototypes demonstrating our
approaches to these UI tasks (@sec:hitl-progress). In general, we will seek to
keep our approach, focused predominantly on map synthesis interfaces, distinct
from that of Jataware and MTRI. We will also develop document-based interfaces
to support TA2 workflows as necessary and in conjunction with Jataware.
Jataware's map-projection system will be required to add projection information
to TA1 outputs prior to ingestion into Macrostrat's systems. Likewise, MTRIs
QGIS plugin will be a key interface through which TA3 manipulates our
vector-tile geologic mapping outputs into binary and probability-based
prospectivity rasters.

### Map-based feedback {#sec:map-interfaces}

The main HITL interfaces produced by Macrostrat will operate in a map-based
environment, and will be designed to support the following tasks:

1. Evaluation of and correction geologic map feature extractions and legend
   information (@sec:map-integration)
2. Evaluation and correction of TA2 mine-site extractions, and linking to
   geologic context (@sec:mineral-site-data)
3. Improving attributes describing geologic units synthesized from map
   descriptions and literature (@sec:entity-characterization)

These interfaces will be built on top of Macrostrat's existing web interfaces,
which are world-class examples of user interfaces for geologic data. Interfaces
already demoed for presenting raster, vector, and site data (e.g.,
@fig:paired-vector-raster and @fig:mineral-sites) will be adapted to support
these integrations. Several prototypes have already been demonstrated
(@sec:hitl-progress).

The key codebases for this work are the
[`UW-Macrostrat/web`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/web) and
[`UW-Macrostrat/web-components`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/web-components)
GitHub repositories. The components housed in these repositories will be used to
develop HITL interfaces across different subsystems (e.g., for map integration;
@sec:map-integration).

![Map interface showing both vector and raster datasets for the same geologic 
  map, in an interface with synthesized legend information. This demo interface was produced as a prototype for future feedback interfaces and is available on [Macrostrat's staging website](https://staging.v2.macrostrat.org/maps/127).](img/paired-vector-raster.png){#fig:paired-vector-raster
width=70%}

### Map extraction editing {#sec:map-editing}

While initial extractions demonstrated by TA1 pipelines are impressive, it is
likely that human intervention will be required to produce GIS datasets of map
points, lines, and polygons that are suitable for downstream use. We will
produce a system that solves the topology of a TA1 geologic map and creates a
representation that can be rapidly edited. This system will be based on the
Mapboard GIS system, which combines the purpose-built
[**Mapboard GIS**](https://mapboard-gis.app) iPad application for pen-based
mapping with a PostGIS-based topology management system (@fig:mapboard-postgis).
This topology management system will allow geologists to rapidly edit geologic
maps, both via iPad streaming digitizing and using standard GIS platforms (QGIS
and ArcGIS). This system will support both pipeline feedback to TA1 performers
and the final production of high-fidelity, topologically correct geologic
mapping datasets that can be integrated into Macrostrat and passed to TA3. The
topology engine is an open-source component housed in the
[`Mapboard/topology-manager`](https://github.com/Mapboard/topology-manager)
repository. This engine will be supplemented with data migration scripts and
management APIs that will be part of the Macrostrat system deliverable
(@sec:macrostrat-system) for CriticalMAAS Phase 1.

</div>

### Document-based feedback interfaces {#sec:document-interfaces}

The potential also exists for Macrostrat to contribute to the development of
document-based feedback interfaces. xDD has produced visualization interfaces
for page-based document annotations (@fig:cosmos) in support of the COSMOS
pipeline (@sec:geologic-literature). These components, housed in the
[`UW-COSMOS/cosmos-visualizer`](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos-visualizer)
GitHub repository, can be adapted to support TA2-supporting user interfaces.
However, given our primary focus on map-based feedback interfaces, we will
likely seek to defer to Jataware's work in this domain.

# Current activities

In the first two months of CriticalMAAS, the Macrostrat team has made
substantial progress towards the goals of Phase 1, in line with its proposed
work plan (@sec:milestone-index). We have made progress along several lines.

## System and interaction design {#sec:schemas}

The Macrostrat team has been a major contributor to the design of CriticalMAAS
data schemas
([`DARPA-CRITICALMAAS/schemas`](https://github.com/DARPA-CRITICALMAAS/schemas)),
for harmonizing TA1-3 datasets and ensuring their interoperability. We have
worked closely with the other TA4 teams and TA1-3 performers to ensure that the
data schemas are specific and well-designed; we have also been an advocate for
including geologic data objects in the schemas, to support our pursuit of linked
geologic data objects.

## Prototype HITL interfaces {#sec:hitl-progress}

We have made substantial progress towards the development of HITL interfaces in
support of TA1-2 pipelines. Macrostrat's main web interface is already being
adapted to support CriticalMAAS tasks, with new pages for
[map development](https://staging.v2.macrostrat.org/map/dev), an
[index of available maps](https://staging.v2.macrostrat.org/maps), and pages for
individual map datasets (e.g.,
[Huntington, UT](https://staging.v2.macrostrat.org/maps/66)). We have produced
prototype interfaces for evaluating vector/raster map alignment
(@fig:paired-vector-raster), viewing mineral site datasets (@fig:mineral-sites),
and topological editing of map extractions (@sec:map-editing;
@fig:mapboard-postgis). These interfaces will be extended and adapted, but many
of the key new technical components (e.g., serving raster datasets;
@sec:raster-data) have now undergone initial validation.

## Literature extractions {#sec:xdd-set-progress}

The xDD system and COSMOS document extraction pipeline are being used to provide
literature artifacts and a full-text searchable database ready for TA2 use, both
for USGS documents and the broader geologic literature. These endpoints will
underpin the development of new capabilities for surfacing document context
(@sec:geologic-literature) and interface development for TA2
(@sec:document-interfaces).

We are beginning to transition to **GeoKB** as a source of USGS documents. As
part of this transition, we switched from using the USGS Zotero instance as the
primary metadata source for target documents to the GeoKB SPARQL instance, under
the guidance of Sky Bristol. This aligns us with the storage and knowledge plans
of Sky's group at USGS. This includes storing the `w3id` stable URLs, which will
allow us to link directly to the original source for each USGS PDF.

We have created a document set (`criticalmaas`) defined as the union of these
documents with the USGS series publications (doi prefix of `10.3133`). This set
is available within the xDD system and queryable using its API. For instance,
[snippets of documents mentioning the _Bonneterre Dolomite_](https://xdd.wisc.edu/api/snippets?set=criticalmaas&term=Bonneterre%20Dolomite),
a key unit in the Viburnum Trend and type locality of Mississippi Valley-type
ore deposits, can be retrieved. Additionally, we are in the process of running
COSMOS, word2vec, and doc2vec pipelines for the entire set (these are running in
CHTC infrastructure and done to varying degrees of completion). None have live
endpoints yet for the entire `criticalmaas` set (though we have them complete
for the GeoKB-based articles). _These endpoints will be in place by the Month 3
hackathon._

# Index of milestone progress {#sec:milestone-index}

## Milestones 1 and 2

We are making progress on all proposed milestones. All but one deliverable
proposed for execution by Month 4 has crossed key thresholds in readiness and is
approaching completion, except for a single deliverable in Task 3B. The early
establishment of key capabilities allows us to focus on building integrations
with other performers (in all TAs) during and after the Month 3 hackathon.

## Later milestones

We have made some progress to later Phase 1 milestones, as well:

- Subtask 1B **Milestone 4** _(Month 7)_: Pipeline for locating and extracting
  entities and augmenting Macrostrat database: _In early exploratory phases with
  CS graduate and undergraduate students supervised by co-PI Venkataraman
  (@sec:entity-characterization)_.
- Subtask 3A **Milestone 4** _(Month 7)_: Adapt Mapboard GIS topological editing
  for map geospatial/topology correction: _Key demonstration/validation has been
  accomplished (@sec:map-editing)_
