# Report period

This **Milestone 5** report describes the the technical progress of the
UW–Madison – Macrostrat team on the CriticalMAAS project, from March 30 – May 7
(Month 8). It sets final expected capabilities and integration plans for the end
of Phase 1, based on the work completed to date and the codebases described in
the [Milestone 4 report][milestone_4_report] in April 2024.

# Research and technical progress

The UW–Madison – Macrostrat team has made significant progress on the
CriticalMAAS project during the reporting period. The team has continued to
develop the [core Macrostrat codebase][gh:macrostrat] and extend it for project
objectives, particularly around map ingestion, geologic entity characterization
from the literature, and new APIs to provide targeted subsets (based on
lithology, map descriptions, etc.) of geologic map data. Additionally, we have
continued to develop the [Mapboard topology manager][gh:topology-manager]
codebase for editing geologic maps. Taken together, these elements form the core
of a system that can integrate and provide access to geologic maps to feed to
TA3.
